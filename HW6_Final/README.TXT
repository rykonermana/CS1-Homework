This project is supposed to work by starting off the program by initiating Main's PSVM method.
With this final project, I decided to try and start it from scratch. I wanted to see how much
I actuallly knew of the subject matter. The result was surprising as I could only do about half
of what is needed to perform HW5, let alone testing it with assertions in HW6. I left comments
at the top of the classes to say what I did and didn't know. Long story short, I wanted to learn
how to code something like this, not learn to copy-paste and accept that something works without
knowing why it does.
